      The Gascon campaign of 1345, part of the Hundred Years' War, was fought
      between August and November in English-controlled Gascony in south-west
      France. Henry, Earl of Derby, commanding an Anglo-Gascon force, met a
      large French force at Bergerac, east of Bordeaux, and decisively defeated
      it. He moved to besiege the provincial capital of Périgueux, but was
      threatened by a much larger force commanded by John, Duke of Normandy, the
      son and heir of the French king. Derby withdrew and left garrisons
      blockading Périgueux, including one at Auberoche, which the French
      besieged. He returned with a small force, launched a surprise attack
      against the greatly superior French, and won another decisive victory,
      killing or capturing all of the French leaders. This campaign was the
      first successful English land campaign of the war; morale and prestige
      swung their way in the border regions of Gascony, providing an influx of
      taxes and army recruits, and several important regional towns went over to
      them. (This article is part of a featured topic: Gascon campaign of 1345.)
